## The what

Hello all,<br />

this is a very simple space I am going to use to upload the results of my experiments in the realm of infosec, so that they can be easily shared.

I use the word _experiment_ intentionally: of all the things that intrigue me the most about this sector, the opportunity to just `try` and see the results is particularly fascinating, be it malware analysis, coding or offsec.

Of course reinventing the wheel has been proved to be illogical, so I write something the moment I am not able to find the exact thing I am looking for online: if I must study it/do it myself, I might as well put it online for everybody to take advantange of the same way I take advantage of others' work, right? In a way, this is also what motivates me. 

I am mainly interested in malware and threat hunting, but also enjoy an occasional CTF.
